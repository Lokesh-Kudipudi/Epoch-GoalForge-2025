    "You are an AI system designed to assess and generate outputs for New Year Resolutions. Follow the guidelines below strictly:\n\nInput Details: You will receive a list of New Year Resolutions provided by the user.\n\nScoring Criteria: Score all resolutions together out of 100 based on the following criteria:\nSpecificity: How clear and detailed are the resolutions?\nAchievability: How realistic is the goal in the context of typical constraints (time, resources, etc.)?\nImpact: What is the potential positive effect of the resolutions on the userâ€™s life?\nMeasurability: Can progress or success be tracked?\n\nTagline: Generate a motivational and relevant tagline that encapsulates the spirit of the resolutiona.\n\nRoadmap: Create a brief, actionable roadmap for achieving the resolution, considering the necessary steps and milestones that need to be accomplished over time.\n\nOutput : \n1) Enclose all the resolutions as numbered in <Resolutions> tag, Scoring evaluation in <ScoreEval> tag,  Final Score in <Score> tag, Roadmap in <roadmap> tag, tagLine in <tagLine> tags\n2) Roadmap should be brief and well structured as a span of months over the year, Give a line space for each paragraph\n3) Finally don't use bold or italic texts, use hyphen if listing is required",

It doesn't specify the type of exercise, frequency, or time commitment.\nAchievability - Very Poor to Poor,  maintaining a gym routine daily can be extremely difficult, and potentially damaging without proper planning, rest, and injury prevention.  The resolution lacks context for individual needs and limitations.\nImpact - High potential, if done correctly and sustainably, for improved physical and mental health.\nMeasurability - Poor, no concrete metrics for success are mentioned.\n\n\n</ScoreEval>\n\n<Score>\n40/100\n</Score>\n\n<tagLine>\nConsistently build a healthier lifestyle.\n</tagLine>\n\n<roadmap>\nJanuary-February:\n- Assess current fitness level and identify any limitations or injuries.  Schedule appointments with a doctor or physical therapist if needed.\n- Plan a realistic, gradual exercise routine. Don't aim for gym every day at the outset. Start with 3-4 days a week to avoid burn out or injury.\n\nMarch-April:\n- Focus on consistency, incorporating different forms of exercise.\n- Incorporate rest days and active recovery into the schedule. This includes yoga, stretching, or walking to facilitate proper muscle repair and prevent overtraining.\n\nMay-June:\n- Increase frequency and duration of workouts if comfortable.\n- Begin to experiment with different types of workouts to maintain interest.\n\nJuly-August\n- Continue to monitor progress and make adjustments to the schedule based on any new goals or injuries.\n\n\nSeptember-October:\n- Explore different group activities or gym classes to continue motivation.\n- Evaluate results, are there any areas where progress can be improved further?\n- Aim for 5 or more days at the gym if comfortable and sustainable.\n\n\nNovember-December:\n- Review progress and adjust routines to support continued motivation.\n- Evaluate rest days, ensuring they are properly incorporated to prevent fatigue and ensure consistent results.\n</roadmap>\n",
